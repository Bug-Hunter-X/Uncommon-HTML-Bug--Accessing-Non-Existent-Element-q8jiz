This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug related to JavaScript interaction. The bug occurs due to an attempt to access an element in the JavaScript code that doesn't exist in the HTML structure. This can lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior.  The solution involves carefully ensuring that the JavaScript code correctly reflects the HTML structure before attempting to interact with elements.
